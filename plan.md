# Interactive storytelling talk

## Two aspects
- procedural generative (examples: dwarf fortress, etc)
- interactive/nonlinear (Choose your own adventure, facade, galatea)

## Show examples
- something like DF
- facade
- galatea?

Two parts: fuzzy and technical

## Fuzzy: how do you model a narrative?
- Vonnegut's shapes of stories
- Vlad Propp

## Technical: implementation
- three layer: ontology, agents, actions
- multi-agent systems
- OZ project
- how Facade works

## Punch and Judy demo
- hopefully?
- or at least an example of how I'm going about building it

## Impact of research
- obvious use: games
- also: training, interactive (art, museum) exhibits,
