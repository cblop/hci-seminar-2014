## Generative and interactive narratives
---
## Generative narratives
- No pre-written story or narrative exists.
- The narrative emerges as a result of a series of complex interactions in the game.
- This tends to happen in sandbox-style, open-world games
- Examples: Civilisation, Dwarf Fortress, some MMORPGs
---
## Interactive narratives
- The narrative is pre-written with several branches
- Player's interactions decide which branches play out
