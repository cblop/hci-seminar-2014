# Generative and interactive narratives

---
# Generative narratives

- No pre-written story or narrative exists.
- The narrative emerges as a result of a series of complex interactions in the game.
- This tends to happen in sandbox-style, open-world games
- Examples: Minecraft, Civilisation, Dwarf Fortress

---

## Interactive (non-linear) narratives

- The narrative is pre-written with several branches
- Player's interactions decide which branches play out
- Usually implemented as multiple endings in games
- Examples: Choose Your Own Adventure, Mass Effect, RPG games

- story emerges from conversation

---
# Façade

- created by Mateus and Stern at Georgia Tech
- only one room, two (other) characters
- interact by typing in natural language sentences

Three layers:

- actions/events

---

# How Facade does it

- Based on OZ project drama manager
- Dramatic elements are divided into 'beats'
