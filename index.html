# Generative and interactive narratives

---
# Generative narratives

- No pre-written story or narrative exists.
- The narrative emerges as a result of a series of complex interactions in the game.
- This tends to happen in sandbox-style, open-world games
- Examples: Civilisation, Dwarf Fortress, some MMORPGs
