# Generative and interactive narratives

# Generative narratives

- No pre-written story or narrative exists.
- The narrative emerges as a result of a series of complex interactions in the game.
- This tends to happen in sandbox-style, open-world games
- Examples: Minecraft, Civilisation, Dwarf Fortress

---

## Interactive (non-linear) narratives

- The narrative is pre-written with several branches
- Player's interactions decide which branches play out
- Usually implemented as multiple endings in games
- Examples: Choose Your Own Adventure, Mass Effect, RPG games

# Have any games done both?

# Galatea

- interactive fiction/text adventure
- one character, one room
- story emerges from conversation

# Fa√ßade

- created by Mateus and Stern at Georgia Tech .red[*]
- only one room, two (other) characters
- interact by typing in natural language sentences

# Vladimir Propp

- created a formalism for Russian folk tales
- split stories into series of sequences
- generalises to other stories quite well

---
# Vladimir Propp

- 7 character functions (hero, villain, helper, etc)
- 31 story functions, for example:
  - STRUGGLE: Hero and villain join in direct combat
  - UNRECOGNIZED ARRIVAL: Hero unrecognized, arrives home or in another country

# How to make a generative, interactive narrative

# How Facade does it

- Based on OZ project drama manager
- Dramatic elements are divided into 'beats'
- Agents interact with each other
- Story is guided by the drama manager

# That's the way to do it!

---

# Punch and Judy

- Start with an animation
- Very simple to model
- Limited number of characters
- Characters are pretty simple

---
# Implementation

- narrative ontology
- multi-agent system (BDI)
- drama manager
- logical reasoner
  
---
# Propp-inspired formalism

- 8 characters (Punch, Judy, Baby, Clown, Policeman, Monkey, Crocodile, Devil)
- 7 possible scenes (babysitting scene, policeman scene, sausages/crocodile scene, etc)
- Narrative shape is generally climactic
- Agents' behaviour changes the outcome of these scenes

---
# OWL-DL ontology

- This formalism is described using OWL-DL
- Ideal for capturing relations and semantics
- Constrains the domain

---
# Logic programming

- Once a situation is recognised, can work out steps to a goal
- If situation changes, can work out new steps
- Based on Event Calculus, Situation Calculus

---
# Characters and emotion

Each character has a main emotional attribute, and a health component.

- Punch: anger
- Policeman: suspicousness
- Clown: happiness

Their behaviour changes according to an emotional score from 1 - 10.


---
# Interaction

We want to mimic audience participation similar to real P&J shows:

- Agents react to noise in environment
- Interaction with smartphones

---
# Uses

- games
- training simulations
- interactive exhibitions
