# Generative and interactive narratives

---
# Generative narratives

- No pre-written story or narrative exists.
- The narrative emerges as a result of a series of complex interactions in the game.
- This tends to happen in sandbox-style, open-world games
- Examples: Civilisation, Dwarf Fortress, some MMORPGs

## Generative example: Civilisation

<!-- screenshot -->

---

## Interactive (non-linear) narratives

- The narrative is pre-written with several branches
- Player's interactions decide which branches play out

## Interactive example: Choose Your Own Adventure

# Have any games done both?

# Galatea

- interactive fiction/text adventure

# How to make a generative, interactive narrative

---

# Implementation

Three layers:

- narrative ontology
- multi-agent system (BDI)
- actions/events

---

# How Facade does it

- Based on OZ project drama manager
- (... etc)

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# That's the way to do it!

---

# Punch and Judy

- Start with an animation
- Very simple to model
- Limited number of characters
- Characters are pretty simple

# Generative Punch and Judy

- characters modelled as BDI agents
- story changes every time
- but the characters are consistent

---
layout: false
# Narrative ontology

- data describing the narrative domain
- adds semantics, meanings
